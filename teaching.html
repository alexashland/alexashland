                    <p>“Professor Ashland was a fantastic English professor.  I have always struggled with English, but Mr. Ashland has helped me improve my writing skills and feel more comfortable with my writing style.  His feedback on papers was good and it helped me to improve on later papers.  He was always available during office hours for any help that I needed.  Overall, he was a great teacher and I would definitely take him for another class.”</p>
                    <p>“Professor Ashland was very helpful and made class interesting.  He did not lecture the entire time, but rather gave us time to work in groups and perform exercises to apply the material.  He was always available for help and replied to emails quickly.  When I was confused on the topic of the paper, he helped explain things better for me, and I thought that he was a fair grader.  He was consistent in his grading and left helpful comments on papers so I could understand what I could have changed.”<p>
                    <p>"“Mr. Ashland effectively taught the class.  I thought he did a great job of explaining what he wanted from his students in our essays and offered time outside of class to meet if we needed extra help.  In class discussions, I thought he did a good job of getting everyone to participate and voice their opinions."<p>
                    <p>“Mr. Ashland is an incredible instructor.  He is very friendly with his class and is always willing to help.  He provides great constructive criticism and knows what some of your best work is capable of.”</p>
                    <p>“Professor Ashland made class very interesting and encouraged a learning environment where we helped our peers and felt comfortable helping them.”</p>

We did an activity that I wrote down as many things as possible in three minutes to help decide what the topic of a paper should be. It was really interesting and actually helped me narrow in to a topic that I could write a strong paper about.  I have more confidence about my research writing now.”</p>
                    <p>“My instructor was really good and also very organized. He helped me work through my thought process whilst allowing me to grow in my creativity.”</p>
